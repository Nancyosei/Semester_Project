Project description
Hotel Management System:
The program displays a welcome message and a menu of options for the user to choose from.
It uses a do-while loop to keep the interaction going until the user is satisfied with their requests.
Depending on the user's choice, the program allows for check-in, check-out, or room maintenance requests.
For check-in, the program gathers information like name, age, gender, and room type, calculates the cost, and provides payment instructions.
For check-out, the program asks for the time of departure and provides a departure message.
For room maintenance requests, the program simulates interaction with an assistant and asks for user feedback.
After completing the requested action, the program asks if the user is satisfied with their request.
If the user is not satisfied, they can continue making requests.
The loop continues until the user is satisfied and decides to exit. The program then displays a thank-you message.
